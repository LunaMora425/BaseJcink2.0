# Jcink Base Skin - 2.0

The default jcink skin, migrated from 1.0 to 2.0

## The Vision

The intention of this repo is to take the provided Jcink Hosting Default skin, which is on version 1.0, and modernize it with new code standards and CSS practices.

This is meant to be more of a base for coders, but the hope is that with a rigorously documented base and the styles all pulled into variables, the skin could be used as-is for anyone who might just want to slap a new color, header, and some fonts on it and get going.
